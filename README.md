# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

This project focuses on generating insights and visualizing theatre kickstarter campaigns data based on Launch Date and Campaign Goals for all types..  To acheive this goal it was important utilize formulas, filters, pivot tables as well as charts within excel.  When done well the ultimate outcome is to enable better decision making and/or provide more insights for further analysis.

### Purpose

This analysis will provide insights on how launch dates for Theatre campaigns and funding goals for all types of campaigns impacted kickstarter outcomes of success, failure, or cancellations of those campaigns.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

countif issues -  copy to adjoining cells error due to not setting the absolute reference

Basic writing syntax errors


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

  - 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  - perform a goals analysis on just Theatre kickstarters not just all to detemrine if Theatre specific outcomes are similar or dissimilar to all campaigns
  - Perform a goals analysis on Theatre kickstarts & Goals by country and by year
  - for the outcomes by launch date it would be effective to show the outcomes as a percentage by month.  when you do this you find that aside from December for all other months the success rate is between 56-66% a range of 10 percent.  
  - identify any outlier data and make decisions about the inclusion of this data
  -  Calculate summary statistics such as measures of central tendency, standard deviation, and variance for the subset of data we are analyzing, namely theatre campaigns
